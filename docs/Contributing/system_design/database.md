# Database

## MySQL

Questions I would love to see answered here in as much detail as possible:
* how it's set up / config (dev, prod)
* different load expectations / host count
* How we use the db from interfaces translate through code to the SQL queries
* Some common breakdowns of tables as class diagrams (especially for more complicated flows)
